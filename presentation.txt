don't spend too much time on the presentation, aaron was talking too much. already 5 minutes in


all technologies, make sure you have them in the presentation


how many pages you have on the project
in my opinion, you should present it yourself, as it is more visual

Don't spend too much time even on presenting the website itself, fabio spent maybe 80% of the time just trying to show the website
